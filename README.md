# **AkamaiCare**  
**A Lokahi Hackathon Solution**  

[![Streamlit Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Demo-Streamlit-blue)](https://akamai-care.streamlit.app/)  
AkamaiCare is a cutting-edge **chatbot application** designed to streamline hospital operations by enabling intelligent querying of patient and hospital databases. Built using **LlamaIndex** and **Gemini Flash 1.5 API** integrations, AkamaiCare provides fast and contextually accurate answers to complex queries, empowering healthcare professionals with actionable insights.

---

## **How It Works**  

AkamaiCare uses the following pipeline:  
1. **Data Integration**: Upload hospital data in the form of **CSVs**, **PDFs**, or other documents.  
2. **Query Agent Creation**: Leverages **LlamaIndex** to construct a powerful **Query Agent** that understands user intent.  
3. **Retriever Agent**: Efficiently retrieves relevant data for precise answers.  
4. **LLM Integration**: Combines these agents with the **Gemini Flash 1.5 API** to provide context-aware, natural language responses.

Ask natural language questions like:  
- _"How many patients were admitted in October 2024?"_  
- _"Which claims were processed by ABC Insurance in the last quarter?"_

---

## **Features**  

- **Advanced Querying**: Supports **natural language queries** for seamless access to patient and hospital data.  
- **Document Parsing**: Handles large-scale data from diverse file formats, including **CSVs** and **PDFs**.  
- **Efficient Retrieval**: Combines query and retrieval agents for rapid, accurate responses.  
- **Streamlit-Powered UI**: A clean, responsive interface for querying data effortlessly.

---

## **Tech Stack**  

- **LlamaIndex**:  
  - Framework for efficient querying and document indexing.  
  - Powers the **QueryAgent** and **RetrieverAgent** for intelligent data access.  
- **Gemini Flash 1.5 API**:  
  - Provides contextual understanding and natural language generation.  
- **Streamlit**:  
  - Lightweight, interactive front-end for easy user interaction.  
- **Python**:
